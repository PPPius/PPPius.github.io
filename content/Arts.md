Art was very important to the mayan civilisation. Their artwork is what shaped and defined their religions, but more importantly most of their artwork was of their kings who they wanted to be remembered all throughout history. Above is an artowork called Maya Stella, it is a piece of artwork that contained writing and carving, generally it was made in honour of the new king and was located near the altar of their place of worship. It is one of their more traditional pieces, that reflects one of their main styles of artwork. Sculpting. Scultping was probably one of their main styles of artwork due to the fact that they had stone and materials like stone in abundance around them. Below is a Chama Style Painting. These paintings were often found along the walls of maya buildings, such as houses temples and other buildings that were used for the public. These paintings portayed the daily life of the maya civilisation, or the famous battles in various myths that the mayan people subscribed to. Not many of these painting remain today because of the buildings being destoryed by erosion or decay over the thousands of years.
