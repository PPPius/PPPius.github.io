The Ancient Mayan Civilisation, is one that has intrigued the world for hundreds of years. It sudden rise to greatness and then mysterious disappearance are what make the Mayan Civilisation one that is quite remarkable. From what we know they were great thinkers, very talented artists and were very innovative. Their beginning predates to 1800 BC, which means their civlisation had lasted for nearly 3000 years when they were depleted in 900 AD. They were one of the powerful societies in the Mesoamerican area, mainly conforming to the area of what we now know to be Guatemala. The Mayans were also renound for their giant stone temples, some of which are still standing today like the one in their capital city of Chichen Itza. Overall the Mayan Civilisation was one that was ahead of its time and one that thrived longer than many cities or nations currently have. It was truly a remarkable city whose contributions to society should not be taken for granted.
