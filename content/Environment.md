The Anicent Mayan Civilisation was based in the low lying rain forests of Southern Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. There was dense forrests as well as giant rivers that were spread across the civilisations. It would have been very hard for them to build any buildings had it not been for their highly innovative ideas. Below is an example of how they used their resources to manipulate their surroundings to fit what they needed. It is a temple, but as you can see the trees all surrounding the temple have been cut down, but the trees around that area were left standing.This is because they were people who only took what they needed and did not waste their resources.
